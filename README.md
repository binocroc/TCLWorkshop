 ## **Introduction**

Tcl is a high-level, general-purpose, interpreted, dynamic programming language. It was designed with the goal of being very simple but powerful. Tcl casts everything into the mold of a command, even programming constructs like variable assignment and procedure definition.

## DAY-1

Sub-Task: Create a command (vsdsynth) and pass .csv file from UNIX Shell to TCL Script

1. Letting the system know that vsdsynth file is a shell script:
   
    ```#!/bin/tcsh -f```
2. Creating the Logo and if-else cases for each of three types of arguements:
   - LOGO:

   - No Argument:

   ![noarg](https://github.com/binocroc/TCLWorkshop/assets/59701387/3a78717a-037e-47c6-a38a-5ce81147f8f4)

   - Wrong/Non-existent Argument:

   - '-help' Argument:

3. Source the UNIX shell to TCL script by passing the required .csv file:

   ```tclsh vsdsyntha.tcl $argv[1]```

## DAY-2

Sub-Task: Converting inputs to format[1] and feeding it to yosys for synthesis, by creating variables and checking the existence of the directories

1. Creation of Variables:

2. Check the existence of directories/files in the obtained path post normalizing:

3. Throw an Error out at the absence of directory/file at the path obtained:

4. Read the Constraint file and proccess parameters for the SDC file:
   - Convert the constraint file into a matrix and define the SDC constraints

   - Categorization of each clocks, inputs and outputs features by porting their location in .csv file:

## DAY-3

Sub-Task: Read the Constraint file and Convert to SDC file

1. Generation of Clock constraints:
